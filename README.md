# VO_miniproject
The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two frames, pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new landmarks.
